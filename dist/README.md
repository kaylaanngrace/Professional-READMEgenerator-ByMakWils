## Description

This applications allows you to write notes and delete them as you please. My motive for this project was to apply my learning of Express.js and improve my coding set. This project was made to put my previously aquired skills in works with Express.js. During this project I learned alot, including deploying a site to Heroku,how to apply express.js, GET and POST routes and more.

Fill in a title and text, to complete your note click the saveicon in the corner next to the plus (this symbol will only appear when a title and text are entered).
