## Description

My motive for this project was to apply my knowledge of Node.js to build an application through the command line. I built this project to test my newly gained backend development skills. This project allows you to generate a readme file after answering a series of questions. During the build of this application I learned a lot about node, npm, inquirer and fs. I also learned how to make code clean and condense while still being functional. 


## Installation

To install this application you must clone it to your computer. Navigate to the main page of this repository. Above the list of files click the button labeled ‘clone’. You can clone the repository with HTTPS, SHH key or GitHub CLI (pick what you prefer). Copy the URL by clicking the clipboard button, or using “Command (CTRL) + C”. Open your computer’s terminal. Navigate to the location you would like to store the cloned directory. Type ‘git clone’ and paste the copied URL. Press enter to create a local clone directory. 


## Usage

To use this application you must first clone it to your computer. (See install
itions for steps on how to clone.) Run "node index" in your terminal under the local cloned directory. Answer the prompts. Once the prompts are completed you will see a console log message informing you, your file was created. The file will be generated in the dist folder. You can copy the code directly to your project.
